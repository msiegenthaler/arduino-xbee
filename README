Arduino Library for XBee communication
--------------------------------------

This library helps the arduino to communicate to remote xbee-attached devices (i.e. a PC or a sensor) via XBee.
By making use of NewSoftSerial it allows to attach the xbee to any two pins and does not block the hardware serial.


The architecture of the library is layered:

- Layer 0: Abstracts communication with the xbee that is directly attached to the arduino.
	Interface: LowlevelXBee
	Implementation: HardSerialApiModeXBee, NewSoftSerialApiModeXBee
- Layer 1: Communication with remote xbees, abstracts the encoding and decoding of messages (rx/tx).
	Implementations: Series1XBee
